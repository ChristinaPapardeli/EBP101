## Folder Description

### Saturday
Includes additional C exercises completed during Saturday lectures. 

ωSunday
Includes additional C exercises completed during Sunday lectures. These mainly extend concepts introduced earlier and emphasize:

### ASSIGNMENT
Contains the main programming C assignment of the course. 
The C program that analyzes a biological sequence and identifies valid coding subsequences (ORFs). It works for DNA or RNA sequence. 
Detects whether the input sequence is DNA or RNA, identifies start codon and stop codons.
Extracts and prints: Start position, End position, Length of the ORF and the ORF sequence itself.

### Environment
Language: C
Developed and tested on a Linux environment
This repository is intended for educational purposes and documents hands-on practice during the MSc course.
